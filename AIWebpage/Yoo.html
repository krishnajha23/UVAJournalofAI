            <h1 class="">Decoding "Y": Machine Learning Algorithms Led to the First Fully Sequenced Human Y Chromosome
                in
                History</h1>
            <h3>Isaac Yoo</h3>

        <p class="lh-lg">Three years ago, in one of the biggest breakthroughs in genetics, the human X chromosome was
            decoded, opening countless doors for gene research and therapy (NIH researchers generate complete human X
            chromosome sequence, 2020). However, the genomic configuration of the Y chromosome, half of the DNA of all
            of
            the men on this planet, lacked comprehensive sequencing (World Bank Open Data, n.d.).</p>
        <p class="lh-lg">Until this year.</p>
        <p class="lh-lg">Just three months ago, in a historic moment, a team of researchers finally fully sequenced the
            human
            Y chromosome, revealing all 62,460,029 base pairs.</p>
        <p class="lh-lg">To provide some background, deoxyribonucleic acid (better known as DNA), is commonly referred
            to as
            the "blueprint" of our body, and this double helix determines the function of various life processes in our
            body, such as protein production and cell division. Furthermore, the structure of our DNA and the sequence
            of
            critical base pairs dictates the function of each gene segment.</p>
        <p class="lh-lg">Our DNA has four nitrogenous bases (adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine) and each single
            helix
            of DNA has a sequence that these bases are ordered in. In the common DNA model, these bases form the
            "bridge"
            aspect that connects the two helixes together and each of these bases will form bonds with another base
            present
            on the other helix, creating the bridge. However, they will only form bonds with one specific other base:
            for
            example, adenine will only form a bond with thymine, and guanine will only form a bond with cytosine. These
            bonds
            between these nitrogenous bases are referred to as "base pairs", and the order of these base pairs in DNA
            define
        </p>
        <p class="lh-lg">its function and how our body reads it. Additionally, chromosomes, structures that store DNA,
        </p>
        <p class="lh-lg">bundle up this genetic material for vital life processes such as mitosis (cell division) and
            reproduction. Consequently, being able to read the sequence of these base pairs in chromosomes is critical
            to
            understanding our DNA.</p>
        <p class="lh-lg">Unfortunately, the Y chromosome was acknowledged by many to be a notoriously difficult
            sequence.
            The presence of complex repeating structures and complicated palindromes and duplications, made fully
            sequencing this chromosome a daunting task (Hallastet al., 2023). But over the past two decades, countless
            studies have slowly chipped away at this chromosome, which led to our previous best model: GRCh38. With a
            seemingly strong reference of about 30,000,000 base pairs, this model at the time seemed rather serviceable
            (Rhie et al., 2023). Unfortunately for the GRCh38 model, as I might have previously mentioned, 30,000,000
            base
            pairs is less than half of the true size of the Y chromosome.</p>
        <p class="lh-lg">In a scientific breakthrough by Rhie et al., through an intensive analysis of telomeres
            (essentially a protective "cap" or sequence of base to prevent chromosomal degradation), not only did this
            new
            model essentially double the number of base pairs we considered, but further corrected and fixed previous
            errors
            found in GRCh38 (2023). We now know that our former knowledge of the Y chromosome was incomplete.</p>
        <p class="lh-lg">However, despite the strong biological and genetic techniques used, it would be entirely fair
            to
            claim that this achievement would not have been possible without the recent advancements in machine learning
            and
            artificial intelligence.
        </p>

        <p class="lh-lg">Perhaps the best way to represent the relationship between the biomedical techniques utilized
            in
            this study and the critical artificial intelligence needed to fully decode the Y chromosome is best summed
            up by
            stating that if this telomeric analysis retrievedand found</p>
        <p class="lh-lg">groups of base pairs, artificial intelligence, and machine learning interpreted them. For
            example,
        </p>

        <p class="lh-lg">given a batch of numerous sequences, how can we predict which sequences are stable, and which
            are
            more comparatively unstable and will likely form alternative structures not commonly found in nature? This
            distinction is not only valuable to have a more complete genomic data set but can have significant clinical
            ramifications as well, especially in gene therapy. The team of researchers knew the answer to this question.
            Machine learning. This study used a machine learning algorithm to predict relative stability and quantified
            stability with a value referred to as the Quadron Score that allowed them to differentiate structures that
            could
            form different sequences and those that could not, offering a more accurate and thorough representation of
            the Y
            chromosome (Rhie et al., 2023). Many more examples, such as using machine learning to weed out false
            positives
            andrepeats in structures, have unraveled this difficult chromosome.</p>
        <p class="lh-lg">Ultimately, this breakthrough in fully sequencing the Y chromosome will cause a significant
            ripple
            effect, opening new opportunities for research, treatments, and studies for decades to come. And in this
            historic, landmark moment of science, to many, one message is made clear.</p>
        <p class="lh-lg">Machine learningand artificial intelligence is the future of biomedicine.</p>

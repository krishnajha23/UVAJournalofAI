            <p class="mx-5">If you're looking for random paragraphs, you've come to the right place. When a random word
                or a random sentence isn't quite enough, the next logical step is to find a random paragraph. We created
                the Random Paragraph Generator with you in mind. The process is quite simple. Choose the number of
                random paragraphs you'd like to see and click the button. Your chosen number of paragraphs will
                instantly appear. While it may not be obvious to everyone, there are a number of reasons creating random
                paragraphs can be useful. A few examples of how some people use this generator are listed in the
                following paragraphs.</p>
            <p class="mx-5">Generating random paragraphs can be an excellent way for writers to get their creative flow
                going at the beginning of the day. The writer has no idea what topic the random paragraph will be about
                when it appears. This forces the writer to use creativity to complete one of three common writing
                challenges. The writer can use the paragraph as the first one of a short story and build upon it. A
                second option is to use the random paragraph somewhere in a short story they create. The third option is
                to have the random paragraph be the ending paragraph in a short story. No matter which of these
                challenges is undertaken, the writer is forced to use creativity to incorporate the paragraph into their
                writing.</p>
            <p class="mx-5">Another productive way to use this tool to begin a daily writing routine. One way is to
                generate a random paragraph with the intention to try to rewrite it while still keeping the original
                meaning. The purpose here is to just get the writing started so that when the writer goes onto their
                day's writing projects, words are already flowing from their fingers.</p>

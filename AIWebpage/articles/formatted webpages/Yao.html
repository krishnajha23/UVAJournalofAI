            <h1 class="">How Will AI Affectthe JobMarket?</h1>
            <h3>By Anna Yao</h3>

        <h3>What is AI?</h3>
        <p class="lh-lg">Artificial Intelligenceis on the rise -from the use of ChatGPT to self-driving cars, AI is
            teaching
            machines to think like humans through data and code. Withthis technology being improved and developed at an
            alarming fast rate, it's safe to say that there will be a notable impact on our future economy as a result.
            However, this leads us to a rather big question. How will it impact our economy andour future jobs? Is AI
            going
            to leave millions without work? On the contrary, will it open up the job market to allow for more
            opportunity?
            (md-br)</p>
        <h3>Automation</h3>
        <p class="lh-lg">It seems reasonable to assume that chatbots which already exist are only going to keep
            improving at
            a rapid pace. This would lead to automation in jobs surrounding repetitive and customer oriented tasks,
            including but notlimited to: customer service, reception, advertising work, retail, and even potentially
            transportation. Doctor�s offices would no longer need workers at the front to check people in nor would
            companies require a salesperson when they have digital marketing and can attract more customers through
            analyzing data patterns. Furthermore, retail workers may no longer be necessary due to automatic checkout at
            grocery stores, and transportation relatedjobs could also slowly deplete with the introduction of self
            driving
            cars and other modes of transport. According to the World Economic Forum, it�s estimated that somewhere
            around
            85 million jobs will be replaced by AI by 2025.</p>
        <p class="lh-lg">However, not all of these changes are necessarily bad. An example of thisin the Industrial
            Revolution of the 1800s, where America underwent drastic changes to their economy and labor force dynamic.
            Although jobs had been dramatically shifted around, this actually benefited both the people and the economy
            by
            getting rid of menial task jobs and allowing for more productivity and higher skilled work. In a similar
            fashion, it can be said that AI will have that effect by expanding the job market dramatically one way with
            an
            opportunity cost of the diminishing of relatively low skilled jobs. (md-br)</p>
        <h3>What Won't Be Affected by AI?</h3>
        <p class="lh-lg">Not to worry -there are still many core professions that will remain nearly untouched and
            unthreatened by the rise in technology. Among these, there are teachers, lawyers,artists, writers, doctors,
            managers, and much more; the reasonfor this is the human element. Although AI can and will become a
            dominating
            force in the future, it is still a network of computers and numbers at the end of the day. Many aspects of
            human
            life are irreplaceable in their own right, such as the creativity of artists and writers or the
            personability of
            teachers. Not only that, but many jobs require the consideration of multiple factors beyond simple data
            -surgeons, psychiatrists, and all sorts of doctors need to factor in the emotional and situational side of
            things in addition to the medical.</p>
        <p class="lh-lg"></p>
        <p class="lh-lg">Lastly, some professions may be untouched for ethical reasons. Fear towards AI taking over the
            world is a dramatic but nonetheless valid concern which keeps the rise and innovations of technology at a
            safe
            rate. Not only that, but the needfor personability will disallow AI from taking some jobs. While it is true
            that
            it will most certainly continue to grow and influence our lives, it is also imperative to recognize the
            limitations and concerns around AI. Learning more about new surges in this field can help promote logical
            and
            knowledgeable opinionsand dissipate any unfounded fears.</p>

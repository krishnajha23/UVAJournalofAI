            <h1 class="">Why do Large Language Models Hallucinate</h1>
            <h3>Writen by ----</h3>
        </div>
        <p class="lh-lg">As part of his bid for early prison release, Michael D. Cohen used Google Bard to identify
            legal citations that were relevantto his case. Cohen gave his lawyer Daniel Schwartz bogus legal citations
            who would later submit them. Cohen believed that Bard was a “supercharged search engine” but Cohen’s use of
            AI goes beyond damaging his appeal for early release. As the star witness for a Manhattan criminal case
            against former President Trump, Cohen has been attacked by Trump’s lawyers as a “serial fabulist.” Cohen’s
            fallacious citations only add fire to the flame.
        </p>
        <p class="lh-lg"> What Bard did was hallucinate; the Large LanguageModel (LLM) generated text that seemed
            syntactically sound
            but was factually incorrect. As embarrassing as this was in federal court, it raises the question of what
            causes LLMs, such as ChatGPT, to hallucinate and what measures can be put in place to forestall
            hallucinations.
        </p>
        <p class="lh-lg">On the other hand, hallucinations in LLMs spread misinformation and raise safety concerns for
            real-world applications. What if all lawyers used ChatGPT to conduct research for their cases? What if
            jurors blindly believed in these lawyers and–in the same thread–believed in ChatGPT? Convictions may be
            misguided; those who are guilty may walk free while those who are innocent may be imprisoned.</p>
        <p class="lh-lg">Generally speaking, hallucinations in LLMs are caused by limited contextual understanding. The
            model is obligated to respond regardless of whether ithas domain knowledge in the field. </p>
        <p class="lh-lg">Moreover, hallucinations can be attributed to trainingdata. When a large corpus of data is
            collected, noise, such as phrases in the output that cannotbe explained in the input, appear. Models pick up
            on the noise and respond in unexpected ways, generating fluent but unsupported text. Duplicates in the
            training corpus can bias the model towards generating frequent phrases. Moreover, the prioritization of
            parametric knowledge–knowledge acquired during pre-training and implicitly stored in model parameters–over
            the provided contextual knowledge results in hallucinations.
        </p>
        <p class="lh-lg">The architecture of LLMs can alsocause hallucinations. LLMs are decoder-only architectures,
            meaning a smaller draft model is used to predict the target model’s outputs. The decoding technique may be
            random in nature, resulting in greater diversity in results but also increased hallucinations.
            Possible solutions to hallucinations can be expensive. To preprocess and enhance the quality of the dataset,
            irrelevant information, duplicates,and outliers can be removed either by hand or through an automated
            process. The model could then be retrained. However, most devices cannot handle training a large LLM on
            their own and even fine-tuninga model may be impossible.
        </p>
        <p class="lh-lg">The most practical intervention may come from humans. Users can ask the modelto regenerate a
            response if the original is gravely wrong. For example, controlled generation and effective prompt
            engineering can also be practiced.When writing a prompt, users can provide enough details about the question
            at hand and the role the LLM should play in answering it. Doing so limits the model’s capacity to
            hallucinate.
        </p>
        <p class="lh-lg">When it comes to LLMs, hallucinations are an unavoidable challenge. When a model generates
            text,it cannot
            tell if its response is actual. Because hallucinations in LLMs can pose a threat to society, researchers
            should not sit idle but devise strategies to ameliorate the frequency of hallucinations. Current mitigation
            strategiesare either too computationally expensive or require manualeffort. </p>

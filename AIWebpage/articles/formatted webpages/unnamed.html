            <h1 class="">The Past, Present, and Future of Privacy in Large Language Models</h1>
        </div>
        <p class="lh-lg">Hello to all! Before diving in, I wanted to first thank you for taking the time to read this
            article. The paper I wish to share with you today is called Privacy in Large Language Models: Attacks,
            Defenses and Future Directions. It was published on October 13 of this year and discusses what privacy is as
            it relates to Large Language Models (LLMs), along with the different strategies that have been used/are
            being continually evaluated today to mitigate sensitive data leakage and exploitation.</p>
        <p class="lh-lg">So to begin, let's first find out how privacy relates to LLM's and why it is so important.
            LLM's require massive amounts of (usually sensitive) training data, which is typically pulled from the
            internet or other public domains. One important aspect of models like ChatGPT is that they must protect the
            privacy of the information used to train such models from harmful adversarial prompts which aim to extract
            sensitive training data from the model itself. This has become a very hot topic for discussion today, as
            failing to protect such sensitive information can result in costly lawsuits for the companies that develop
            these models.</p>
        <p class="lh-lg">The first step in preserving privacy is defining it in mathematical terms so that it can be
            quantified and measured. A popular framework adopted today is Differential Privacy (DP), which the article
            defines as incorporating "random noise into aggregated data to allow data mining without exposing
            participants' private information" (Section 2.2.2). Some of the various problems facing LLMs other than
            simply exposing training data include inference data privacy (sensitive information about previous
            prompts/queries stored by the model) and re-identification (adversarial identification of today lies in
            finding a balance between privacy and utility.</p>
        <p class="lh-lg">There are a great many different kinds of "attacks" that LLMs can fall victim to today, some of
            which fall under the category of backdoor attacks, which, as defined in the paper, "Involve the insertion or
            modification of specific input patterns that trigger the model to misbehave or produce targeted outputs"
            (Section 3.1). Data poisoning, which is a "less potent attack where only a portion of the training data is
            manipulated," offers a vehicle to implement backdoor attacks. More specific examples of this attack are
            covered in-depth in the paper. Another type of attack, which can be considered a different form of a
            backdoor attack, is a prompt injection attack, which is once more defined in the paper as an attack that
            "manipulates or injects malicious content into the prompt or input p given to the model to get the altered
            pattern P&#771, with the aim to influence its behavior or generate unwanted outputs f(P&#771)" (Section
            3.2).
            Additionally, training data extraction attacks are just what they sound like. These attacks depict a
            scenario in which an adversary attempts to recover a model's memorized training data, typically with what's
            known as a "jailbreaking prompt". In contrast, membership inference attacks (MIA) describe scenarios in
            which an adversary already has information on potential samples used within the training of the model and
            attempts to determine whether a particular sample was used in the model's training.</p>
        <p class="lh-lg">While less common, more advanced attacks are discussed within the paper, where an adversary has
            access to more information about the model such as gradients and vector representations which include:
            attribute inference attacks, embedding</p>
        <p class="lh-lg">inversion attacks, prompt extraction attacks, adversarial attacks, side channel attacks</p>
        <p class="lh-lg">As for the defenses to such attacks, we turn back to DP in LLMs, which provide a privacy
            guarantee for the model. One commonly implemented deep learning algorithm today is Differential Privacy
            Stochastic Gradient Descent (DPSGD), which attempts to preserve privacy by adding noise to gradients during
            the training process. The paper covers four distinct types of DP-based LLMs in depth: DP-based pre-training,
            DP-based fine-tuning, DP-based Prompt tuning, and DP-based synthetic text generation, each of which are
            described in greater detail in the paper. Secure multi-party computation (SMPC) -based LLMs provide another
            solution to the privacy problem. SMPC is a "cryptographic technique that allows multiple parties to
            collaborate in training a machine learning model while maintaining the privacy of their individual data" and
            which "enables these parties to jointly compute model updates without exposing their private data to others,
            ensuring that each party can contribute their local data to the training process without disclosing any
            sensitive information" (Section 4.2). Another privacy solution in the world of LLMs is Federated Learning,
            which the paper defines as "a privacy-preserving distributed learning paradigm enabling multiple parties to
            train or fine-tune their LLMs collaboratively without sharing private data owned by participating parties"
            (Section 4.3). However, this framework comes with its own limitations and vulnerabilities, in that they can
            leak data privacy if they suffer specific types of inference attacks.</p>
        <p class="lh-lg">DP based LLMs are widely adopted for data privacy, but they face notable</p>
        <p class="lh-lg">limitations. One limitation is the theoretical worst-case bounding, as DP-tuned LLMs</p>
        <p class="lh-lg">scenarios it is uncommon to come across such a capable adversary, creating a gap between
            theoretical analysis and practical scenarios, which might include a simple training data extraction attack.
            Additionally, the utility of DP-based LLMs tends to degrade, especially when applied to complex downstream
            tasks, despite claims that careful tuning can achieve similar performance to non-DP tuning on simpler tasks.
            This degradation weakens the motivation for using DP-based fine-tuning.</p>
        <p class="lh-lg">Toward the end of the paper, the text shifts to outlining several key research areas. First,
            with regard to prompt injection attacks-which aim to influence LLMs' output-the domain as it relates to
            privacy is still relatively uncharted, and the need for more robust defenses will be required as current
            systems continue to fall victim to these attacks. The second area focuses on future improvements in SMPC for
            privacy-preserving inference in LLMs. Challenges and ongoing efforts involve integrating Model Structure
            Optimization (MSO) and SMPC Protocol Optimization (SPO) to design efficient, versatile privacy-preserving
            algorithms. The third area addresses the alignment of privacy with human perception, emphasizing the
            limitations of current privacy studies and the need for a broader understanding of privacy as defined by
            societal norms, which may be influenced by social norms, ethnicity, religious beliefs, and privacy laws. The
            fourth area discusses empirical privacy evaluation, emboldening the need for more nuanced and detailed
            metrics beyond Differential Privacy parameters and highlighting the importance of assessing privacy in
            real-world scenarios. The final section discusses contextualized privacy judgment, emphasizing the lack of a
            general privacy violation detection framework and the need for frameworks with reasoning ability in complex,
            long-context situations-especially when working with LLM-based chatbots.</p>
        <p class="lh-lg">In summary, this article navigates through the past, present, and future of privacy in LLMs by
            examining the critical role of differential privacy and the various types of attacks and defensive
            strategies employed today. The paper discusses other solutions to privacy as well, such as Federated
            Learning, along with its limitations. Looking ahead, the article highlights several key research areas
            within which lie many unanswered questions, emphasizing the evolving nature of privacy challenges and the
            ongoing efforts to address them.</p>

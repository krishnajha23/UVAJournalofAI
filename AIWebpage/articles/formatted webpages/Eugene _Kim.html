            <h1 class="">Examining Helen Margetts' Institutionalization of Public Sector Artificial Intelligence to
                Revolutionize Modern Governments</h1>
            <h3>Writen by Eugene Kim 8 December 2023</h3>
        </div>
        <p class="lh-lg">In "Rethinking AI for Good Governance," Helen Margetts, a professor at the University of Oxford
            and Programme Director for Public Policy at The Alan Turing Institute, London, proposes a general framework
            for the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in governments as a justifiable means of improving
            current and subsequent federal administrations. Providing context for the relationship between federal
            governments and computational technology, Margetts initially discusses the origin of computers. She briefly
            explains its development as a fundamental weapon used during World War II by the Allied Powers against the
            Axis Powers (Margetts, 2022). During this time, computational technology was primarily under the expertise
            of the government; however, after World War II, computers became progressively outsourced to the public,
            leading to the eventual decline of unique technological proficiency in governments and the growth of
            technological developments driven by private sectors in countries (Margetts, 2022). Inevitably, within the
            past decade, governments realized the potential utility of computational technology (Margetts, 2022).
            Particularly, governments gained a newfound interest in artificial intelligence (Margetts, 2022). In the UK,
            "government announcements that mentioned data science and artificial intelligence rose from fifteen in 2015
            to
            272 in 2018" (Margetts, 2022, p. 361). In the United States, around 45 percent of federal agencies within
            the federal government experimented with AI and machine learning by the end of 2020 (Margetts, 2022).
            Although the use of artificial intelligence in governments is in an infantile stage, its integration seems
            promising (Margetts, 2022).</p>
        <p class="lh-lg">After discussing the emergent presence of computational technology within governments, Margetts
            explains her proposal for how artificial intelligence should be developed as it becomes more integrated into
            governments. One of the primary ways in which artificial intelligence can be incorporated into governments
            is detection, or "taking in information" (Margetts, 2022, p. 361). Before policy-making, governments need
            data and knowledge; therefore, they must be able to "detect (and then minimize) unwanted behavior by firms
            or
            individual citizens" (Margetts, 2022, p. 361). Governments can use machine learning,an application of
            artificial intelligence, to classify activity in wide sample sizes, such as the Internet (Margetts, 2022).
            Machine learning can detect "online harms such as hate speech, financial scams, problem gambling, bullying,
            misleading advertising, or extreme threats and cyberattacks" (Margetts, 2022, p. 362). Applying
            counter-adversarial technology, government agencies can create machine learning classifiers trained to
            automatically track violative content, reducing the chances of offenders working around and evading
            detection
            (Margetts, 2022). To train machine learning classifiers in detecting unwanted behavior, agencies can create
            generative adversarial networks (Margetts, 2022). In generative adversarial networks, two neural networks,
            machine learning that resembles human thinking, will work with each other (Margetts, 2022). One neural
            network will generate unique content based on a given data sample, such as the Internet, and the other
            neural
            network will attempt to determine if the content is from the real data sample or generated (Margetts, 2022).
            As both neural networks continue trialing, they will learn and improve, legitimizing machine learning as a
            viable way of helping government agencies detect and track information(Margetts,</p>
        <p class="lh-lg">2022).</p>
        <p class="lh-lg">Besides detection, artificial intelligence can vastly improve predictions made by the
            government
            (Margetts, 2022). Without access to large data samples, governments can not forecast accurately; however,
            with the help of artificial real data generated by machine learning, particularly neural networks and
            decision
            trees, agencies could make more accurate predictions (Margetts, 2022). A decision tree is a model that draws
            out all of the possible outcomes of a certain subject; with it, policymakers can determine the best possible
            solution to a problem (Margetts, 2022). These types of machine learning models "can greatly enhance the
            prioritization of sites for inspection or monitoring, from water pipes, factories, and restaurants to
            schools
            and hospitals, where early signs of failing organizations or worrying social trends may be picked up in
            transactional data" (Margetts, 2022, p. 363). Government agencies can also use artificial intelligenceto
            predict aggregate demand, "for example, in schools, prisons, or children's care facilities" (Margetts, 2022,
            p. 363). Machine learning can draw out data that reveals needs for the future, helping the government plan
            resources and prioritize significant matters (Margetts, 2022). For instance, machine learning was used
            during the COVID-19 pandemic from 2020 to 2021 to predict aggregate demand for resources "such as
            ventilators, nurses, and drug treatments toward those areas likely to be most affected" (Margetts, 2022, p.
            363). Thus, with the implementation of artificial intelligence, governments can drastically improve
            predictions.</p>
        <p class="lh-lg">The third general aspect that artificial intelligence benefits in helping governments design
            policies is data-driven simulation (Margetts, 2022). Before the emergence of artificial intelligence, the
            primary way of testing out policies was through field experiments: "randomized trials in which the
            intervention is applied to a 'treatment group' and the results are compared with a 'control group'"
            (Margetts, 2022, p. 364). However, these experiments required</p>
        <p class="lh-lg">significant amounts of time and money, were subject to a variety of errors, and were inhibited
            by</p>
        <p class="lh-lg">ethical concerns (Margetts, 2022). With artificial intelligence and agent computing,
            governments do not need to rely on field experiments (Margetts, 2022). In a model based on agent computing,
            individual agents are generated, and each agent has a specific state and behavior; data is drawn out through
            the agent (Margetts, 2022). Agent computing artificially models humans and can be used in replacement of
            real-world test trials (Margetts, 2022). Policymakers can make proposals based on agent computing for a
            variety of situations (Margetts, 2022). In the case of law enforcement, agencies are using agent computing
            to model artificial policemen based on data from the activities of real policemen (Margetts, 2022). This
            modeling is used to test out "different levels of police resourcing and measure the potential effects on
            delivery of criminal justice" (Margetts, 2022, p. 365). Agent computing models can be used to simulate the
            allocation of resources, such as trained professionals, in public sector areas, such as education and health
            care (Margetts, 2022). The United Nations is currently using agent computing to assist developing countries
            in determining public sector policies to prioritize (Margetts, 2022). On its current pacing, further
            development of artificial intelligence canpotentially fully replace real-world testing to simulating, saving
            governments costs.</p>
        <p class="lh-lg">Margetts (2022) proposes specific implementations of artificial intelligence in the government.
            The first proposal is developing "new generalized models of policy-making" (p. 367). Traditionally,
            governments do not use transactional data to predict and simulate instances, resulting in a lack of
            information available for adequate policy-making (Margetts, 2022). Currently, data in the government "are
            compressed within files, available for checking individual pieces of information, but generating no usable
            data for analytics" (Margetts, 2022, p. 367). Since a lot of governmental data is not usable, there are
            substantial delays within policy-making especially in instances that have strict timelines (Margetts, 2022).
            For example, many countries lacked dataduring the COVID-19 pandemic, so interventions were unable to be
            produced timely (Margetts, 2022). Data was not generated in real-time; "in the United Kingdom, for example,
            it turned out that data for deaths were available only several weeks after the death had occurred"
            (Margetts, 2022, p. 367). When data was finally presented and became usable, simulated models on public
            health, health, care, education, and the economy, occurred individually(Margetts, 2022). There was a lack of
            communication between each sector, so legislative proposals only targeted single sectors such as
            "economic recovery or the health crisis" (Margetts, 2022, p. 367). Advanced machine learning could have
            created solutions that targeted multiple sectors at the same time, resulting in substantial amounts of
            progress (Margetts, 2022). If implemented correctly, artificial intelligence could help with generalized
            policy-making and effectively improve future crises.</p>
        <p class="lh-lg">The second and the more ambitious implementation of artificial intelligence presented by
            Margetts (2022) was using it to reform long-standing corrupt government practices in favor of equality and
            fairness. Machine learning can help with "identifying and reforming long-standing biases in resource
            allocation, decision-making, the administering of justice, and the delivery of services" (Margetts, 2022, p.
            367). Current data collection and application in machine learning stem from data generatedby the existing
            governmental system, so biases and inequalities became explicitly depicted within the government (Margetts,
            2022). For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, machine learning detected "many structural inequalities in
            how citizens are treated-for example, in the delivery of health care to people from different ethnic
            groups-just as the mobilization around race has revealed systemic racism in police practice" (Margetts,
            2022, p. 367-368). Therefore, in the future, agencies should use artificial intelligence to create new
            models that "produce unbiased resource allocation methods and decision support systems for public
            professionals, helping to make government better, in every sense of the word, than ever before" (Margetts,
            2022, p. 368).</p>
        <p class="lh-lg">Margetts' "Rethinking AI for Good Governance" proposes many applicable implementations of
            artificial intelligence in governments, fitting the progressive growth of technology in modern society.
            Although her applications are comprehensible and in touch with the current infantile stages of the
            relationship between artificial intelligence and federal governments, her propositions seem to reside in an
            idealistic framework. Margetts suggests that artificial intelligence can significantly improve the
            substantial amount of corruption committed within governments, but she does not take in the perspective that
            policymakers may use artificial intelligence to further commit ethical violations. Since a utopian society
            does not exist,using advanced forms of artificial intelligence in the government may instead further repel
            people's trust in federal administrations. As mentioned in this journal article, Margetts (2022) pointed out
            that there was explicit proof that the government used biases and discrimination when drafting legislature
            during the COVID-19 pandemic.Given the long history of inequality present within the government, using
            artificial intelligence would alarm the public. Gaining the trust of the people would be significantly
            difficult even for a government that does not use advanced technology. Privacy and security concerns may
            already prohibit using artificial intelligence, and further development despite privacy invasion may cause
            irredeemable ethical violations.</p>
        <p class="lh-lg">In addition to skepticism of the reliability of government officials regarding the use of AI in
            goodwill, computational literacy within the government may lead to future legislatures that regulate the use
            of such technology in private sectors. If the government fully achieves the potential benefits of
            artificial intelligence, it may draft policies that limit how far private sector companies may use the
            technology, breaking the technology industry and free market rights.</p>
        <p class="lh-lg">Finally, one potential complex issue that will ensue from the progression of artificial
            intelligence in governments is hiring computer engineers. Margetts (2022) proposes that before any
            technological development is made within governments, progress must occur without the support of theprivate
            sector. Although technologies created within the private sector are far more advanced than technology used
            within the public sector, she believes that the government should develop literacy in artificial
            intelligence
            independent from for-profit organizations to ensure the absence of potential corruptive practices (Margetts,
            2022). While this claim sounds appealing, it may be difficult for the government to incentivize computer
            engineers to work for the federation rather than private companies. If superior monetary incentives were to
            be offered, the government would be obliged to accumulate sufficient funds to pay its employees. Advancing
            artificial intelligence would indirectly cause an increase in taxes paid by the public or a redistribution
            of government spending upon different sectors. Regarding a potential increase in taxes, the public may cause
            an uproar as they scrutinize the benefits-to-cost ratio of the implementation of artificial intelligence. A
            failure or hindrance in the development of such technology in governments will ultimately result in the loss
            of taxpayer money, and the governments would need to face the potential repercussions and backlash set by
            the public. About the potential redistribution of government spending across different public sectors, funds
            specified for certain programs may need to be withdrawn and reallocated to the sector that would be
            responsible for developing artificial intelligence. For example, funding used for the military, healthcare,
            education, and infrastructure may inevitably reduce to increase the available budget for artificial
            intelligence. This may cause unforeseen challenges as other public sectors have a reduced budget in favor of
            developing a new sector. Taking the multitude of factors into account, budgeting is one of the most
            significant obstacles to consider when implementing AI in governance.</p>
        <p class="lh-lg">Providing an in-depth application of artificial intelligence in governmental agencies, Helen
            Margetts proposes well-ground suggestions for the further advancement of technology in the
            federation. However, paralleling the numerous amount of benefits for this endeavor, there are a lot of
            confounding factors that may inhibit its success. Currently, the use of artificial intelligenceis slowly
            growing within governments, and the future outcomes of this ambitious presentation canonly be revealed over
            time.</p>

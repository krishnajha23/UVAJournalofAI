        <p class="lh-lg">There has been a recent surge of interest within the graph neural network (GNN) com-munity
            regarding positional and structural encodings (PSEs) for graph data. A PSE is any encoding which contains
            valuable information regarding a graph’s topology. Most commonly, a PSE takes the form of a matrix P ∈
            &#8477<sup>n×d</sup> which is either added or concatenated with a graph’s node feature matrix X in
            downstream
            architectures. At
            first glance, it may be hard to tell the advantage of using a PSE over a simple node embedding; why have
            both P and X when just X might do?</p>
        <p class="lh-lg">The answer is that most GNN node embedding techniques are ignorant of various graph topological
            features. Morris et al. [2019] and Xu et al. [2019] show that 1-hop message-passing neural networks (MPNNs),
            one of the most common type of GNN, are at most as powerful as the 1-dimensional Weisfeiler-Lehman (1-WL)
            graph isomorphism test [Weisfeiler and Lehman, 1968]. While the 1-WL test is able to distinguish various
            kinds of graphs, there are many graphs which it surprisingly fails to distinguish. Below, Figure 1 gives an
            example of a pair of indistinguishable graphs. Notice that even though the graphs are non-isomorphic, their
            node coloring histograms computed by the 1-WL algorithm are identical. Ideally, non-isomorphic graphs should
            have non-identical node color histograms.</p>
        <p class="lh-lg">More importantly, common substructures such as as cycles and disjointed triangles—which are
            common in molecular and social network data—also cannot be distinguished from each other. These structures
            will map to the same representations by MPNNs, harming their expressive power depending on the given dataset
            and task. As a result, we may make a distinction between node features, which are data and task-specific,
            and graph topological</p>

        <div class="d-flex justify-content-center">

        <p class="lh-lg">Figure 1: An example from Zopf [2022] of 2 non-isomorphic graphs that the 1-WL test and MPNNs
            cannot distinguish.</p>
        <p class="lh-lg">features, which will generalize across structurally similar graphs. 1-hop MPNNs are able to
            create informative node features, but PSEs boost their expressive power beyond the 1-WL test by adding
            topological features that MPNNs would not normally be able to discover.</p>
        <p class="lh-lg">significant amounts of time and money, were subject to a variety of errors, and were inhibited
            by</p>
        <p class="lh-lg">The most common failure case of the 1-WL test is when nodes with statistically similar (yet
            non-isomorphic) neighborhoods receive the same coloring. Therefore, one approach to formulating a graph PSE
            is to assign a unique encoding to every node in order to distinguish all nodes in the graph. The most
            straightforward way to accomplish this is by augmenting each node embedding with random features [Abboud et
            al., 2021, Sato et al., 2021, Eliasof et al., 2023] and propagating those features via standard
            message-passing. However, as Wang et al. [2022] point out, random features have no guarantees for the
            convergence of the augmented node embeddings during training. Further, these random features may struggle to
            generalize to unseen graphs given that nodes in a graph have no canonical ordering. A random feature, while
            able to uniquely identify nodes in a graph, also says nothing about the structural role a node plays in its
            neighborhood. For example, nodes in a cycle should share similar PSEs versus nodes with a single neighbor.
            In short, a powerful graph PSE must incorporate the graph structure into its encoding and cannot just
            uniquely identify nodes.
        </p>
        <p class="lh-lg">An alternative approach is to utilize the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the graph Lapla-cian
            matrix L, which can be intuitively thought of as the coefficients and basis functions which make up the
            given graph signal. Prior to the widespread use of neural networks, Belkin and Niyogi [2001] used the
            eigenvectors of L for graph clustering, lending to the idea that the eigenvectors of L have important
            information regarding the graph topology itself. To give some intuition on how the graph spectrum provides
            topological information, Figure 2 below shows a molecular graph’s eigenvectors as colors on the molecule
            itself. Each entry of a given eigenvector corresponds to a node in the graph, and the color of each node
            represents the magnitude of its corresponding eigenvector entry. Notice how the first eigenvector neatly
            splits the two halves of the molecule at the central carbon atom, and how higher-frequency eigenvectors
            induce finer and finer colorings.</p>

        <p class="lh-lg">Figure 2: Entries of various eigenvectors coloring the nodes of a molecular graph [Lim et al.,
            2022]. Eigenvectors are increasing in frequency from left to right.</p>
        <p class="lh-lg">Dwivedi and Bresson [2021] and Kreuzer et al. [2021] incorporate the Laplacian’s spec-trum
            directly into their neural architectures as features which are added/concatenated to the node feature
            matrix. While these methods take MPNNs beyond the 1-WL test and boost GNN performance on several tasks, they
            are largely restricted to small graphs given the com-putational cost of computing the eigendecomposition of
            the graph Laplacian. Furthermore, the graph Laplacian’s spectrum is only guaranteed to be real-valued if the
            Laplacian is sym-metric, restricting its use to undirected graphs (save for certain modifications by
            Furutani et al. [2019]). This makes a Laplacian-based PSE potentially unsuitable for directed graph data
            such as social networks. Finally, any PSE which relies on the spectrum of the graph Laplacian will have
            trouble distinguishing non-isomorphic co-spectral graphs: graphs which are non-isomorphic but share the same
            eigenvalues.</p>
        <p class="lh-lg">Still there are other flavors of graph PSEs. For instance, random walk-based PSEs stand between
            random features and Laplacian eigenvectors in terms of mathematical sophistication. Li et al. [2020] and
            Dwivedi et al. [2022] introduce versions of such a random walk (RW) PSE, using the relative random walk
            landing probabilities between nodes as positional features. Recently, Ma et al. [2023] have shown that a
            learned version of this RW PSE can also be used to compute shortest-path distances between nodes. This
            result generalizes the PSE by Ying et al. [2021] which uses the shortest path distances between nodes to
            bias attention scores in graph transformers, and their more general framework leads to substantial
            improvements in performance. Generally speaking, RW-based PSEs have been shown to be generally more
            efficient and performant over spectral methods. Yet, RW encodings may also incur high computational cost for
            large graphs due to requiring powers of the graph’s RW matrix. Furthermore, a RW PSE’s performance is
            intimately tied to the given graph task. For example, any task which involves heavy use of directed acyclic
            graphs—such as code abstract syntax trees for program analsyis or abstract meaning representations for
            language translation—will see less benefit from an RW encoding. This is because, in these particular graphs,
            random walks never return to preceding nodes, and so common strategies, such as using the self-landing
            probabilities during a random walk, will fail to produce discriminative features.</p>
        <p class="lh-lg">In sum, discovering new graph PSEs is a recent endeavor in the GNN community, and the quest for
            an expressive, powerful, and computationally efficient PSE continues. An ideal graph PSE would be (1)
            discriminative, taking a GNN beyond the 1-WL test, (2) powerful, improving performance on the tasks of
            interest, (3) generalizable to out-of-distribution and unseen in-distribution graph structures, and (4)
            computationally efficient. Random feature methods are able to satisfy (1) and (4) but not the others, while
            spectral and RW methods trade off (1) and (4) for mostly (2). Wang et al. [2022] and Huang et al. [2023]
            offer PSEs which improve on (3) by constructing provably stable encodings which respect graph sym-metries,
            making their PSEs more generalizable to unseen graphs. However, these methods, while theoretically
            satisfying, seem to not generally offer performance improvements on par with simpler spectral and RW-based
            PSEs. Practically speaking, then, it may be of great interest to the GNN community to investigate whether
            objectives (1)–(4) are actually mutu-ally achievable. One may suspect, for example, that (3) and (4) cannot
            be achieved jointly, but this lacks rigorous proof.</p>
